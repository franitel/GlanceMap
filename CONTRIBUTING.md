# Contributing

## Before You Start

1. Use JDK 17.
2. Install Android SDK components for `compileSdk = 36`.
3. Verify local build:

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin :glancemapcompanionapp:compileDebugKotlin
```

## Project Conventions

- Keep transfer protocol constants in `:transfercontract` only.
- Keep watch background services under `app/.../core/service`.
- Keep feature UI code under `app/.../presentation/features/<feature>`.
- Prefer small, focused files over large multipurpose files.

## Branches and PRs

1. Create a focused branch per change.
2. Keep PR scope small and cohesive.
3. Include a short architecture impact note in the PR description if package/file layout changes.

## Validation Checklist

Run before opening a PR:

```bash
./gradlew :app:compileDebugKotlin
./gradlew :glancemapcompanionapp:compileDebugKotlin
```

Run the full local CI gate before merging release or public-repo changes:

```bash
./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt :app:compileDebugKotlin :glancemapcompanionapp:compileDebugKotlin :app:testDebugUnitTest :glancemapcompanionapp:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :glancemapcompanionapp:lintDebug
```

If your change touches transfer behavior, also verify:

- watch receives transfer requests,
- status/ack messages still flow phone <-> watch,
- LAN HTTP transfer path still works.

## Location Changes

If your change touches `app/.../core/service/location`, also:

1. Follow `docs/location/CONTRIBUTING.md` for validation and PR evidence.
2. Update `docs/location/THRESHOLDS.md` when changing location constants.
3. Update `docs/location/ARCHITECTURE.md` and/or `docs/architecture/wear-location-service.md` when package ownership or flow changes.

## Compass Changes

If your change touches compass behavior, also:

1. Follow `docs/compass/CONTRIBUTING.md` for validation and PR evidence.
2. Update `docs/compass/THRESHOLDS.md` when changing compass constants.
3. Update `docs/compass/ARCHITECTURE.md` and/or `docs/architecture/wear-navigation.md` when ownership or flow changes.

## Documentation

When structure or behavior changes:

1. Update relevant file-level comments (if needed).
2. Update architecture docs in `docs/architecture/`.
3. Update root `README.md` if setup or module responsibilities changed.
4. If adding or upgrading third-party dependencies, update `licenses/THIRD_PARTY_NOTICES.md` and `licenses/RUNTIME_DEPENDENCIES_RESOLVED.txt`.

Before making the repository public, follow `docs/PUBLIC_REPO_CHECKLIST.md`.
