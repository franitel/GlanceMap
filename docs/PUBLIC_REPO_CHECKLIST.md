# Public Repository Checklist

This checklist is for making the GitHub repository public. It is separate from
Google Play review, but some legal and privacy checks overlap because publishing
source code and bundled assets is still public distribution.

## Current Status

- Secrets: `PASS`
  - Current tracked files do not contain release signing secrets.
  - Active `main` history was rewritten to remove the previously committed
    uncommented `RELEASE_*` signing values from `gradle.properties`.
  - Keystore and signed artifact file patterns are ignored in `.gitignore`.
- Build artifacts: `PASS`
  - Signed `.aab`/`.apk` files and module `release/` directories are ignored.
- Privacy policy page: `READY WHEN PAGES IS ENABLED`
  - GitHub Pages source files are under `docs/`.
  - Planned URL: `https://glancemap.github.io/GlanceMap/privacy-policy/`
- Project license: `READY`
  - The root `LICENSE` is MIT and covers GlanceMap project code unless another
    file says otherwise.
  - Bundled third-party themes, icons, map styles, and vendored code keep their
    own provenance and license notes under `licenses/` and `third_party/`.
- OpenAndroMaps/Elevate permission: `RECEIVED`
  - Project owner confirmed agreement from OpenAndroMaps and Tobias Kuehn on
    2026-04-20.
  - Keep the original agreement messages private, and record dates/scope before
    switching visibility.
- GitHub repository metadata: `READY`
  - Repository description should be: `Offline Wear OS navigation with an Android companion for transferring maps, GPX tracks, POIs, and routing data to your watch.`
  - Repository topics should include: `android`, `kotlin`, `wear-os`,
    `offline-maps`, `mapsforge`, `gpx`, `brouter`.
  - Set the repository website to `https://glancemap.github.io/GlanceMap/`
    after GitHub Pages is enabled.
- Security contact path: `READY`
  - `SECURITY.md` points vulnerability reports to `Glancemap@protonmail.com`.
- Third-party bundled assets: `READY`
  - No remaining bundled-theme redistribution blocker is recorded for the
    current public repository plan.

## Before Switching GitHub Visibility

1. Confirm GitHub code search does not find the old signing password or active
   `RELEASE_*=` signing lines.
2. Confirm no keystore, signed bundle, APK, `google-services.json`, or
   `local.properties` file is tracked:

   ```bash
   git ls-files | rg -i '(\.aab$|\.apk$|\.jks$|\.keystore$|\.p12$|\.pfx$|google-services\.json|local\.properties)'
   ```

   Expected result: no output.

3. Archive third-party approval details outside the public repo:
   - OpenAndroMaps/Elevate
   - OpenHiking
   - French Kiss
   - Hike, Ride & Sight, if the approval terms are only stored in private messages
   - Voluntary Theme
   - OS Map Theme
   - For each approval, keep:
     - parties,
     - request/response dates,
     - approved scope for public source distribution, APK/AAB bundling, and modified/adapted assets.
4. Re-check `licenses/COMPLIANCE_STATUS.md` and update its review date/status.
5. Update GitHub repository metadata:
   - Replace the description with the concise public description above.
   - Add the suggested repository topics.
   - Leave the website empty until GitHub Pages is actually enabled.
6. Enable GitHub Pages from branch `main`, folder `/docs`, then confirm
   `https://glancemap.github.io/GlanceMap/privacy-policy/` loads.
7. Enable GitHub private vulnerability reporting after the repository is public
   if you want GitHub-native private advisories in addition to `SECURITY.md`.

## Useful Local Checks

```bash
git status --short --branch
git log --all --oneline -G'^RELEASE_(STORE_FILE|STORE_PASSWORD|KEY_ALIAS|KEY_PASSWORD)=' -- gradle.properties
git grep -n -I -E '(BEGIN .*PRIVATE KEY|AIza[0-9A-Za-z_-]{35}|ghp_[0-9A-Za-z_]{36,})' -- .
./gradlew ktlintCheck detekt :app:compileDebugKotlin :glancemapcompanionapp:compileDebugKotlin :app:testDebugUnitTest :glancemapcompanionapp:testDebugUnitTest :app:lintDebug :glancemapcompanionapp:lintDebug
```

For the first two history/current signing checks, expected result is no output.
